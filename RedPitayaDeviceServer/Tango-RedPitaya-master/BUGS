[X] Formats don't work
	Missing % sign

[X] Scope data is not working
	Converted to commands instead of attributes, but still, it's not the data I'm looking for
	Using webapp interface, still I hope that command version is only temporary

[X] scope_freq is getting labeled as DDR Voltage and appears only in expert view
	Apparently rebooting tangobox helps...

[ ] Device server segfaults when restarted from Astor
	Problem appears only when setting up a new device and server is run from command line

[ ] Device state is flapping between UNKNOWN and FAULT while reconnecting
	Now it's just UNKNOWN...

[X] LED status is not showing up
	int type causes errors, 'int' works (wtf?)

[X] Starting generator on one channel starts second channel too with previous parameters
	Looks like it's a bug in RP device or "generate" application
	That's indeed a bug on the device&tools side. I can't do much about it.
	Just turning off the other channel when turning on the desired.

[ ] Scope data exceeds size limit (even if sending only 4 datapoints) when sent as attribute

[X] Can't get generator state attributes
	Unnoticed typo :)

[ ] When disconnecting power, state goes UNKNOWN instead of trying to reconnect.
	It really reconnects, but doesn't show it

[X] LEDs are shifted (LED1 behaves like LED2)
	Looks like desired LED functionality
